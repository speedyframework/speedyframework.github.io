					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Persistence</h3>
					</div>
					<h5>Simultaneous JDBC and JPA Support</h5>
					<p>The data access layer components developed with Speedy can
						employ both JPA and JDBC simultaneously. Transactions can span DAO
						components using any of those two strategies. In addition, you can
						configure each module's data access preference independently.</p>
					<h5>Pure JDBC Access without SQL Boilerplate</h5>
					<p>JDBC infrastructure provides a light-weight ORM mechanism
						that is sufficient to map relational tables to domain classes. By
						mapping domain classes to database tables, you can perform
						database CRUD operations and query data without SQL boilerplate.
						Not only do you query individual tables, you can also perform
						advanced queries that join multiple tables as well.</p>
					<h5>Multitenancy Support</h5>
					<p>Speedy Framework facilitates the development of multi-tenant
						applications that serve multiple tenants and use the same database
						for all of them. Although the private data of tenants is strictly
						isolated, the interaction between tenants is possible for
						administrative purposes. Speedy Framework provides administrative
						screens to manage tenants and you can use them in your projects.
					<p>The first step for multitenancy is to identify the current
						tenant from the authenticated user. After logging in, it must be
						identified and stored in a context for the use of various modules.
						Of course, after closing the session, it must be removed from the
						context. Speedy Framework identifies the current tenant from
						username which is given as user@tenant format. This identification
						strategy can be customized according to the needs of the
						application.</p>
					<h5>Base Domain Classes</h5>
					<p>Speedy Framework provides base classes for entities and
						value objects and fulfills multi-tenancy, optimistic locking and
						soft delete requirements for objects of classes derived from them
						regardless of underlying persistence mechanism, JDBC or JPA.</p>
					<h5>EntityDao and EntityService</h5>
					<p>The EntityDao and EntityService classes are designed to
						execute CRUD operations for any entity, regardless of type. You
						can perform CRUD operations without writing a single line of code
						for DAO and service layers. In particular, it facilitates
						prototyping in the early stages of the development process.</p>
					<h5>Search Criteria API</h5>
					<p>The search criteria API allows you to query entities for
						both JDBC and JPA. The UI layer's search capabilities often use
						this facility at the backend, and this abstraction makes these UI
						components independent of the data access infrastructure details.</p>
					<h5>Paging and Lazy List</h5>
					<p>Database tables can hold millions of records, but UI
						components cannot handle all at once. Therefore, enterprise
						applications mostly use paging and lazy loading solutions. The
						Speedy Framework provides a pageable query structure and offers a
						lazy list. The lazy list can be seen as a specific java list
						implementation that holds only some records from the underlying
						data source and loads the remaining on demand. You can use it as
						simple as any ordinary list implementation without thinking about
						underlying lazy loading details.</p>
					<h5>Soft Delete</h5>
					<p>Instead of deleting mission-critical data from database,
						Soft-delete facility can be used to deactivate it by marking as
						deleted. This data can be restored and activated again or
						permanently deleted.</p>
					<h5>Refreshing Beans After Mission-critical Data Changes</h5>
					<p>The application context may contain some beans configured
						according to some data, and this data can be changed at run time.
						In this case, these beans should be informed and allowed to adjust
						their status for new conditions. You can annotate these kind of
						beans, so they can be refreshed when some critical data is changed
						and certain events are fired. Some security features use this
						facility to activate configuration changes immediately.</p>
					<h5>Sample Data Provider</h5>
					<p>In addition to Spring Boot's script-based data population
						mechanism, Speedy Framework supports programmatic sample data
						population mechanism that enables the use of several services and
						DAO beans. You can generate sample data without SQL.</p>
					<h5>H2 Database Debugger</h5>
					<p>H2 is a lightweight Java-based database that can store data
						in memory or in a file system. While running your application, you
						can use Spring Boot's activator to investigate the data in the H2
						database. Beside this, with Speedy Framework's H2Debugger, you can
						intercept any method invocation and open the H2-Console from the
						code. H2-Console opens in the default browser and you can see the
						data in the current active transaction. This can be used to
						investigate the data generated by transactional test methods that
						will eventually be rolled back at the end of the test.</p>

				<section id="security" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Security</h3>
					</div>
					<h5>Users, Roles and Groups</h5>
					<p>Management screens are available for users, roles, and
						groups. Using these screens, administrators can create new records
						or modify or delete existing ones. They can also build role and
						group hierarchies, assign roles, add users to groups and reset
						users' passwords. The Speedy Framework sends users an automatic
						e-mail after the account creation and password reset. Users can
						update their profiles and change existing passwords.</p>
					<h5>Access Control Lists and Resource Level Security</h5>
					<p>Access control lists are widely used to manage restrictions
						for critical secure resources. You can use access control lists
						for any resource in your Speedy applications. The management
						screens simplify the configuration of access control lists and
						allow them to be updated at run time.</p>
					<h5>Security Events and Security Audit Logs</h5>
					<p>Security events are automatically published in
						authentication and authorization processes. These events are
						captured, security audit logs are created from them and these logs
						are saved for further analysis. Speedy Framework provides
						administrative screens for searching and browsing security audit
						logs. You can also handle these security events and apply detailed
						analysis for your own projects.</p>
					<h5>Updating Http Security in Runtime</h5>
					<p>Spring Security can be configured to intercept urls and
						apply some restrictions. Speedy Framework makes this configuration
						updatable. You can change access configuration in runtime.</p>
					<h5>Redirection After Login</h5>
					<p>Enterprise applications can have a variety of users and
						their main focal points may differ from each other. For example,
						while the customer management screen may be the main screen for
						sales representatives, this screen has no special priority for a
						human resources specialist. The most important screen for him may
						be a screen related to organization hierarchy. With Speedy
						Framework's redirection feature, you can direct salespeople to the
						customer management screen and human resources specialists to the
						organization management screen.</p>
					<h5>Access Restriction to Login Page for Authenticated Users</h5>
					<p>Attempts to access the login page after successful
						authentication doesn't make sense and, can be confusing in some
						cases. Therefore, Speedy Framework doesn't allow authenticated
						users to access the login page and redirects them to the
						application's homepage.</p>
					<h5>Bypassing Authentication</h5>
					<p>During development, developers often want to see what they
						are developing, so they run the application repeatedly as a
						particular user. After some repetitions, the login process for
						each attempt can be annoying. Speedy Framework makes it possible
						for a particular user to skip the login process, so developers can
						access the homepage directly without logging in. This feature
						significantly speeds up the development process.</p>
					<h5>User Substitution</h5>
					<p>Users can perform some operations on behalf of other users.
						Substitution rules can be configured and audit logs hold
						information related with both actual user and substituted user.</p>
					<h5>Captcha Support</h5>
					<p>Captcha strengthens security by eliminating repetitive
						malicious access attempts to steal user passwords. It guarantees
						that the authenticated user is not a machine, but a real person.
						Speedy Framework provides captcha validation support and this can
						be activated/deactivated easily.</p>
					<h5>IP Restrictions</h5>
					<p>Enterprise applications are generally security-sensitive
						applications, and restricting some users to access from outside a
						particular region is a common security requirement. Speedy
						Framework applies IP checks by default. If you want to allow some
						users to login from a specific IP block, simply enter this IP
						block from user management screen.</p>
					<h5>Password Management</h5>
					<p>Enterprise applications are subject to strict security
						policies. Managing user secrets takes part in the heart of them.
						Thanks to Spring Security, most of requirements to keep them safe
						are met by default. Speedy Framework makes Spring Security's
						capabilities more useful, and adds some supporting features.
					<p>Passwords should be considered valid within a period of time
						and must be changed periodically. Speedy Framework checks the
						expiration time and directs the current user to the password
						change screen.
					<p>System administrators can be allowed/forbidden to define a
						password for other users. They can only be restricted to reset
						other users' passwords; so that the passwords can be stored as a
						secret known to the owners. After resetting a password, the
						generated password is sent to the user by e-mail and the system
						administrator does not see the user's new password.</p>
					<h5>Page Level Security</h5>
					<p>Speedy Framework introduces configurative page level
						security. Read or write access to any UI field and actions on any
						page can be restricted for individual users, roles or user groups.
					</p>
					<h5>Root Access</h5>
					<p>Root access in computer systems provides unlimited access to
						any file, and the root user can do anything within the system.
						Speedy Framework uses this concept for enterprise applications.
						For unlimited access to anything within the application, Speedy
						Framework offers a root user and a root role. This feature
						significantly speeds up the development process and can be
						enabled/disabled easily.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="i18n" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Localization</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Spring's MessageSource is a powerfull i18n feature for
						enterprise applications. It resolves localized messages from
						*.properties files and allows them to be reloaded for changes in
						these files. Speedy Framework takes this feature a step further
						and allows administrators to update localized messages from
						screens at runtime. Additionally, new language supports can be
						added. The dynamic user interface and reporting capabilities of
						Speedy Framework allow screens and reports to be redesigned from
						scratch, and these screens and reports can be easily
						internationalized with this feature.
					<p>Although MessageSource bean is a Spring managed bean,
						libraries that are not familiar with Spring, such as reporting,
						can use it as a ResourceBundle.
					<p>The current user's locale can be determined from user
						preferences, from request or from a cookie and can be changed from
						the user interface. Others modules are automatically notified for
						locale changes and they can adjust themselves according to new
						locale settings.
					<p>Captions for UI components can be localized declaratively by
						specifiying message key and their localized values are
						automatically displayed according to the given key.</p>
					<h5>Localized Enum Values</h5>
					<p>Enum values can be easily localized. If a localized message
						exists with the fully qualified name of the enum, Speedy Framework
						displays it.</p>
					<h5>Localized Exceptions</h5>
					<p>For message aware runtime exception instances, localized
						messages are displayed on the screen.</p>
					<h5>Updating Regional Settings</h5>
					<p>The user profile screen contains a section for regional
						settings and users can change their default language, country,
						time-zone and currency preferences.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="auditing" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Audit Logging</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Service and entity level audit logging can be configured
						declaratively and system adminitrators can keep track of method
						invocations and can see which part of any entity has been changed
						by whom and when. Audit log records can be categorized and each
						module can add new categories to the system. Audit log records can
						be analyzed on the screen.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="monitoring" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Performance Monitoring</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Speedy Framework can collect runtime statistics such as
						minimum, maximum and average execution times for methods.
						Administrators can analyze them on the screen and capture clues
						for bottlenecks. Methods that are subject to performance
						monitoring can be defined declaratively by XML and annotations.
						Performance monitoring can be activated/deactivated on the screen
						at runtime.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="reporting" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Reporting</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Speedy Framework provides a production-ready reporting
						screen. This screen allows users to enter report parameters and
						generate reports in various formats such as PDF, XLS, DOC and
						HTML. Users can view, download, or send the report directly as an
						e-mail attachment.
					<p>Reporting screen also allows administrators to configure
						access restrictions for reports. Access restrictions use
						resource-level security infrastructure and access control lists.</p>
					<h5>Report Designer</h5>
					<p>New reports can be designed from scratch on-demand and
						existing reports can be modified completely. Visual modifications
						can be done easily by dragging and dropping report elements.</p>
					<h5>Reporting Server</h5>
					<p>Speedy Framework exposes an endpoint to fulfill report
						requests. Users can send reporting queries to this endpoint and
						receive the generated report in response. They can save report
						queries and recreate the same report. Thereby, changes in data can
						be monitored over a time period. This feature is also useful for
						interactive drill-down reports. Report rows can contain links to
						detailed reports and these links can be used even in PDF or XLS
						formats.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="ui" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>User Interface</h3>
					</div>
					<h5>Model View Presenter and Events</h5>
					<p>Thanks to Vaadin, UI components can be easily implemented
						with Java. However this should not encourage developers to write
						all code in their UI classes. The logic of appearance and
						presentation should be separated. MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
						recommends this. Speedy takes this up seriously and strongly
						encourages using MVP for UI components.
					<p>Todays interactive web applications require UI components to
						comunicate with each other. This forces them to be coupled with
						other components, making it difficult to manage the code. To
						eliminate this unwanted dependency and simplify the interaction
						between UI components, Speedy Framework offers an event bus.
						Published events are also multicasted through Spring's application
						event publisher and they can be handled by Spring's event listener
						beans.</p>
					<h5>Production-ready Pages for Home, Login and Error</h5>
					<p>The first impression is essential and the homepage gives the
						first impression of web applications. Production-ready homepage,
						login page and error page implementations are presented to you by
						Speedy Framework in advance. You can use, customize or completely
						replace them for your projects. Their layouts can be redesigned
						with UI Designer at runtime.</p>
					<h5>Dynamic UI Design</h5>
					<p>Placement of UI components in pages can be configured easily
						by dragging and dropping. Speedy Framework provides ready to use
						UI templates, but it doesn't enforce any fixed UI design.</p>
					<h5>Information and Confirmation Messages</h5>
					<p>Speedy Framework provides an infrastructure for information
						and confirmation messages. Localized information and error
						messages are automatically displayed according to the outcome of
						the service layer. The approval (confirmation) flow is performed
						automatically for annotated presenter methods.</p>
					<h5>Uncaught Exceptions</h5>
					<p>Unhandled exceptions are processed just before the response
						is returned and an appropriate error message is automatically
						displayed. If a localized error message can be resolved, it is
						displayed. Otherwise, Speedy Framework displays a general error
						message so that the user scenario is executed without crash.
						Message aware runtime exceptions and errors related with access
						denial and data integrity violations can be easily converted to
						localized error messages.</p>
					<h5>Declarative model binding</h5>
					<p>Speedy Framework introduces declarative model binding for
						annotated UI fields. You can also bind nested complex objects to
						UI components declaratively.</p>
					<h5>Dirty Checking</h5>
					<p>For web based enterprise applications, it is important to
						alert the user for unsaved changes before exiting the current
						scenario. Speedy Framework provides a built-in mechanism for
						dirty-checking before navigation.</p>
					<h5>List and Detail Templates for CRUD</h5>
					<p>For an enterprise application, the majority of use cases can
						be classified as CRUD. CRUD scenarios require a search and
						filtering featured list for records. They also require detailed
						form components to edit the records. Speedy Framework provides
						list and detail templates ready for use. You can implement
						fully-featured CRUD scenarios including search, listing, creation,
						updating and deletion in a few minutes. These templates use
						EntityService and EntityDao at the back end so you don't need to
						implement anything for the service and dao layers. List and detail
						templates come with built-in paging, filtering and bulk processing
						capabilities and their layouts can be customized with UI Designer.</p>
					<h5>Application Menu and Navigation</h5>
					<p>Speedy Framework creates an application menu by scanning
						annotated page classes. Annotations are also used for navigation
						and breadcrumb configuration. UI modules use this infrastructure
						to place their administrative pages in appropriate positions in
						the application menu. The placements, titles, and icons of menu
						items can be changed by administrators at run time.</p>
					<h5>Dashboard</h5>
					<p>You can implement several small UI widgets for your
						application and display them with Speedy Framework's built-in
						dashboard. Application level dashboard can be customized for each
						user independently.</p>
					<h5>View Model</h5>
					<p>Speedy Framework introduces a proxy-based mechanism for
						enriching pojos with new capabilities such as dirty-checking and
						change-tracking. Dirty-checking allows detection of unsaved
						changes and change-tracking makes it possible to handle old and
						new values of fields and added/removed items of collections.</p>
					<h5>Tool Bar</h5>
					<p>Annotated methods can be used for building tool bars. The
						captions and visual features of the tool bar buttons can be
						customized and they can be enabled or disabled according to page
						level security configuration. Speedy Framework handles them
						automatically by using declarations given by method level
						annotations and you can override these declarations.</p>
					<h5>Testing UI Components</h5>
					<p>Vaadin Test Bench simplifies the UI tests. If you have a
						Vaadin Test Bench license and want to use it for your projects you
						can also take advantage of Speedy Framework's additional UI
						testing capabilities such as application bootstrapping, automatic
						web driver management and pause option after test scenarios.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="validation" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Validation</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Speedy Framework provides service level declarative and
						entity level programmatic validation capabilities based on JSR-303
						validation specs. Validation errors from service level validation
						checks can be displayed as localized error messages and the
						corresponding UI components can be marked.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="email" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Email</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Speedy Framework supports both synchronous and asynchronous
						email sending. In case any error in synchronous sending, the user
						is alerted directly. For asynchronous mails, Speedy Framework
						retries to send again in a few minutes. Administrators can list
						all emails created in the system. They can edit them or compose
						new mails.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="help" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Help</h3>
					</div>
					<h5>Context Sensitive Help</h5>
					<p>Speedy Framework provides context-sensitive, multilingual
						help facilities. Help content can be stored in the database or
						file system and can be accessed via the REST API.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="file" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Documents</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Most enterprise applications are in close contact with
						documents and files. Speedy Framework introduces a REST based API
						for document uploading, downloading, updating content and
						versioning. You can store documents in the database or file
						system.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="cache" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Cache</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Speedy Framework simplifies multi-tenant access to caches
						and allows debugging cache content at runtime.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="others" class="doc">
					<div class="page-header">
						<h3>Other Features</h3>
					</div>
					<h5>Pluggable Modules</h5>
					<p>Speedy modules can be integrated together like plug-ins.
						They can enrich capabilities of others, change their
						configurations and add extra functionalities.</p>
					<h5>Type Safe Environment</h5>
					<p>In addition to configuration features with text files such
						as *.properties and *.yml files, Speedy Framework introduces a
						type-safe variable definition and usage mechanism, so that
						environmental variables become easier to follow, and the affected
						codes can be easily detected after refactoring. Beside Speedy's
						type-safe configuration they can be overridden by text files as
						well.</p>
					<h5>Secure and Easy ThreadLocals</h5>
					<p>ThreadLocals can only be accessed within the same thread and
						they must be cleared at the end. Otherwise they may cause
						information leakage, if their corressponding threads are pooled.
						Speedy Framework keeps values of thread local variables between
						sequential requests and safely removes them at the end of
						request-reponse process, so that the contextual data can be used
						inter-request operations without the possibility of data leakage
						caused by dirty thread locals.</p>
					<h5>Business Events</h5>
					<p>Business event firing configuration can be made
						declaratively before or after any service method, or in case of
						any exception. The published events include the method parameters
						and the returned value as contextual data.</p>
